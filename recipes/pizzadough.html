  <h1>Quick and Easy Pizza Dough</h1>

    <p><em>This is the easiest, best pizza dough recipe. With just 6 ingredients and <br>no fancy flours required, this pizza crust meeds just one bowl, about 3 seconds <br>of kneading, and just 30 minutes to rise.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2-2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour OR bread flour¹ divided (250-295g)</li>
        <li>1 packet instant yeast² (2 ¼ teaspoon)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛-¼ teaspoon garlic powder and/or dried basil leaves <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil + additional</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water³ (175ml)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup (125g) of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. <br>If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir well very well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add another 1 cup (125g) of flour. Add any additional flour as <br>needed (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional ⅓ cup),<br> stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is<br> beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for<br> visual cue). The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be<br> manageable with your hands. </li>
        <li>Drizzle a separate, large, clean bowl generously with olive oil and use a pastry<br> brush to brush up the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball<br> and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl. Use your hands to roll the pizza dough<br> along the inside of the bowl until it is coated in olive oil, then cover the bowl<br> tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place.</li>
        <li>Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size. If you intend to bake<br> this dough into a pizza, I also recommend preheating your oven to 425F (215C)<br> at this point so that it will have reached temperature once your pizza is ready to bake.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a<br> lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times).</li>
        <li>Use either your hands or a rolling pin to work the dough into 12" circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a parchment paper lined pizza pan and either pinch the edges or<br> fold them over to form a crust.</li>
        <li>Drizzle additional olive oil (about a Tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use<br> your pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust)<br> with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the pizza to keep the dough<br> from bubbling up in the oven.</li>
        <li>Add desired toppings (see the notes for a link to my favorite, 5-minute pizza sauce<br> recipe!) and bake in a 425F (215C) preheated oven for 13-15 minutes or until toppings<br> are golden brown. Slice and serve.</li>
      </ol>
