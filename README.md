# odin-recipes
First Project of the Odin Project

In this project I will use the HTML skills I have learned to create a websites that functions as Recipe Collection. I will use various HTML elements, Text, Lists and Images, to create the website and I will put emphasis in the right formatting and aesthetic of the code practice readability and proper form.

I also started to implement simple CSS and Flexbox to style the pages.

ALL the content (recipes, images and videos) are "borrowed" from
